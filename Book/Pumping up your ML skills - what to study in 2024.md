<h3> A soft dive into machine learning</h3>




<div style="text-align: justify;">
I would like to talk about books that explain the fundamental concepts of machine learning in an easy-to-understand way. Let's start with [`Machine Learning Simplified (2022)`](https://themlsbook.com/). Its author uses clear examples to explain key concepts, algorithms, and methods. In the course of the narrative, he gradually moves from simple examples to more complex ones.

In the first part, he gives basic terms (from AI systems and data science to deep learning and so on), and in the second part, he explains complex concepts such as logistic regression, Bayesian modeling, and tree data structure. The second part is not yet fully published; new chapters are released gradually and can be explored as they are released.
The author of the book is an MLOPS engineer. His experience in teaching ML has shown that introductory materials on machine learning are written either in a scientific and incomprehensible way for beginners or, on the contrary, too simplistic and without specifics. So he developed his own textbook, in which he tried to explain the basics of ML in simple words. In reviews of the book, write about the clear structure, explaining complex processes with the help of simple examples. At the beginning of each chapter, the author gives a summary of its content and reveals key concepts; this approach allows you not to waste time reading familiar information.

Introduction to algorithms and machine learning
Another book aimed at those new to the topic of ML is [`Introduction to Algorithms and Machine Learning (2022)`](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36895578). It was written in support of the [`Eurisko`](https://www.eurisko.us/) computer science course for high school students at [`Pasadena High School`](https://www.pusd.us/phs). Its program is considered one of the most intense, on par with programs at prestigious technical universities like MIT. The author of the book is a developer and teacher at MathAcademy, a service for learning higher math. He finds established approaches to teaching computer science boring and ineffective, so he develops math courses and textbooks that can solve this problem.

Introduction to Algorithms and Machine Learning begins with introductory programming exercises and dives into machine learning math: data mining and sorting, object manipulation, regression, and classification. In its format, the edition resembles a classic textbook, in which, after the theoretical material, there are several tasks to consolidate what has been learned. For example, in the chapter about graphs, the author proposes to compose a dataset for training a model and analyzing it, which will generate a decision tree of a certain type. At first glance, the book may seem difficult for beginners because it contains a large number of code examples, graphs, schemes, and mathematical formulas. However, the material is presented in an accessible way and in portions, so its consistent study allows you to understand the concepts discussed.</span></div>
